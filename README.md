# HMM
Repository for an HMM voice recognition project. Will be made private once it is finished.

To run you need jupyter. Can be installed using pip, I believe:

pip install jupyter

to run the notebook file, use the command

jupyter notebook HMM.ipynb

Inside the notebook, which is opened in your browser, you run the file by pressing the "Run" button in the options menu for the current code block.
